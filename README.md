# README

GallerySpace is a simple image-uploading site where users display their images in galleries, using basic early-Internet styling.

A tribute to the bygone days of MySpace and GeoCities, you can create your own galleries, find galleries by theme, and friend other users to keep up with their galleries too!

## Setup

GallerySpace is built using Ruby on Rails version 5.2.2. The backend relies on PostgreSQL. Make sure you have both installed, and that PostgreSQL is up and running.

To set up a local version:
1. Download the repository.
2. Navigate inside the 'gallery-space' directory.
3. Run 'bundle install' to install needed gems.
4. Run 'rails db:create' to create the database.
5. Run 'rails db:migrate' to run migrations.
6. Run 'rails s' to start the app.
7. Open your browser and go to 'localhost:3000/'.
8. Enjoy!!

## Credits

GallerySpace was created by Isa Levine and Chris Cable at Flatiron Seattle. Feel free to fork and modify as desired! All we ask is that you credit us with the original concept, code, and design.

Rest in peace, MySpace and GeoCities...
